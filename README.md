# README

Version used during development:

* Ruby 2.5.1
* Rails 5.2.3
* PostgreSQL 11.2


To run the application:

`bundle install`

`rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`

`rails s`

You can login using one of the following users.

user1@test.com

user2@test.com

user3@test.com

user4@test.com

user5@test.com

For all of them I used the super safe password `password`


NOTE: I wanted to but I didn't add any specs, and I feel really dirty about it. But I could really spend additional time on it. And yes I didn't use any frontend framework.
